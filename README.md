# Ad Challenge

This is an ad I made with native HTML, CSS and JavaScript for a coding challenge.

The responsive works well for smartphone screen ratios. I hope to improve it also for tablets.  
The hardest part was keeping the display responsive after the end of the animations.

# How to view

Opening the index file locally doesn't display an image loaded in the css file with a webkit css property.  
In order for it to load, I used Live Server extension with VS Code.  

Tested and developed on Chrome.
